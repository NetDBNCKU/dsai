  description: 
    `Data Mining/Machine Learning Theory and Practice. 
    In this course, a series of DM/ML research topics will be taught. 
    Thereare some short technical lectures and short academic/industrial panel discussions. 
    We emphasize the importance of practices in this course. 
    Your brain, theoretically, is a kind of models which should be trained by lots of instances. 
    Based on the spirit of trial-and-error, we will give 5 HWs, 2 projects, one paper presentation, 
    and mostly, you should program individually.`,
